<P dir=ltr></P>
<P>The classic Cognitive Science paradigm is inspired by <STRONG>the analogy of thinking with computation</STRONG>.&nbsp;On this view, thinking is the result of the manipulation of mental representations by mental procedures.&nbsp;As we have seen, there are tensions within the paradigm itself about the kinds of mental representations and procedures that best account for the phenomena of interest, namely intelligence and cognition.&nbsp;Here are, roughly speaking, the possibilities that we have discussed so far:</P>
<OL>
<LI><STRONG>Rules and search</STRONG>: Intelligence is the result of knowledge, in the form of rules, combined by search through knowledge space.</LI>
<LI><STRONG>Concepts and association</STRONG>: Intelligence is the application of knowledge, in the form of concepts, applied through association and matching.</LI>
<LI><STRONG>Images and imagery</STRONG>: Some intelligence involves the use of visual mental images as representations and the abilities of the mind&#8217;s eye as procedures.</LI></OL>
<P>The diversity among this group shows that the thinking/computation paradigm is not a conceptual monolith but rather a model to guide the formulation of theories of cognition.&nbsp;</P>
<P>One of the limitations of the thinking/computation model is that it does not extend to the hardware involved.&nbsp;That is, the digital computer, which performs the computing, is nothing much like a <STRONG>human brain</STRONG>, which is what seems to perform the labor involved in human cognition.&nbsp;Turing, you may recall, thought that the difference between brain and computer is of no consequence: After all, he argued, intelligence is strictly a matter of software.&nbsp;So, the details of hardware are not relevant in the end.&nbsp;However, the difficulties encountered in deriving an overall account of intelligence and cognition on the basis of this assumption have convinced many that it simply does not hold up.&nbsp;</P>
<P>One obvious alternative source of inspiration for theories of intelligence and cognition is the study of the hardware involved, namely the <STRONG>brain</STRONG>.&nbsp;Studies of the brain have revealed that the brain is hugely complicated network of 10 to 100 billion tiny individual cells now called neurons.&nbsp;Curiously, no individual neuron seems to correspond to anything like a symbol in the class Cognitive Science paradigm.&nbsp;Also, the way in which neurons work does not bear much resemblance to the way that symbols participate in computations.&nbsp;Neurons seem to work by modifying or <STRONG>constraining</STRONG> the behavior of other neurons through their connections.&nbsp;In addition, instead of performing computations in a one-at-a-time or <STRONG>serial</STRONG> manner, neurons in the brain operate all-at-once or in <STRONG>parallel</STRONG>. </P>
<P>The paradigm of cognitive modeling inspired by studies of the brain is usually known as <STRONG>connectionism</STRONG> because of the densely interconnected nature of neurons in the brain.&nbsp;Connectionist models of cognition seek to imitate the workings of the brain by employing neuron-like units as the basic form of representation and a process of constraint satisfaction as the way in which the units are manipulated.&nbsp;See the table below.</P>

<P>In the first half of this module, we will begin our discussion of connectionism with a little bit of background information.&nbsp;Then, we will proceed to a consideration of one version of connectionism, namely that which concerns <STRONG>localized</STRONG> networks.&nbsp;Next&nbsp;we will proceed to a discussion of what are called <STRONG>distributed</STRONG> networks and a comparison between connectionist and classical accounts of intelligence and cognition.</P>
