<H3>8a8: Connectionism: Strengths of Localized Networks</H3>
<P>Among the strengths of localized networks is that they are fairly easy to interpret.&nbsp;Each unit in the network has a unique and straightforward conceptual interpretation.&nbsp;Thus, if you have a clear idea of what concepts and relationships hold in a particular problem, it is relatively easy to set up the corresponding network and run the model.&nbsp;Then, it is simple to understand the result obtained by the model.&nbsp;You can then check the performance of the model against the performance of human subjects to see if the model is indeed capturing what is happening cognitively.&nbsp;For this reason, localized networks are often said to be <STRONG>transparent</STRONG>; that is, the meaning of nodes and of network states is easy to interpret in symbolic or propositional terms.</P>
<P>Furthermore, the procedure for obtaining results from the model, namely settling the network through spreading activation, is effective, flexible, and somewhat plausible neurologically.&nbsp;The procedure is <STRONG>effective</STRONG> in the sense that it will generally reach a state corresponding to the best solution after a reasonable amount of effort.&nbsp;This effectiveness does come at a cost, however.&nbsp;There will be situations in which the network will settle into a <STRONG>local minimum</STRONG>; that is, a state corresponding to a solution that is not quite the best one possible.&nbsp;Think of the network&#8217;s settling as if its current state were a ball rolling downhill in a hilly landscape.&nbsp;The ball will usually come to rest at the lowest point in the landscape, rolling through the dips and over the bumps en route.&nbsp;It can happen, however, that the ball will be trapped in a dip that is not the lowest point in the landscape but is too big for the ball to escape from with the energy that it has.&nbsp;This dip is a <STRONG>local minimum</STRONG>, as opposed to the lowest point, which is the <STRONG>global minimum</STRONG>.&nbsp;However, the situation is not too bad.&nbsp;Firstly, procedures like those used in DECO and ECHO can be shown to get the optimal solution about 80% of the time.&nbsp;Secondly, even the solutions corresponding to local minima are usually good enough.&nbsp;That is, they will get the job done, even if they are not quite as optimal as they could be.&nbsp;Thirdly, this property of behaving optimally only some of the time agrees with the limitations of human cognition.&nbsp;That is, as you may imagine, humans do not always make the best decisions are find the best explanation for a given situation.&nbsp;The fallibility of the connectionist approach can be a positive point, provided it makes the same kinds of mistakes that people do.</P>
<P>The examples above should also suggest that the localized network approach is <STRONG>flexible</STRONG>; that is, more or less the same sort of representation and procedure can be applied to widely different problems.&nbsp;This quality exists because connectionist work is centered on the notion of optimizing the <STRONG>satisfaction of constraints</STRONG>, and many problems can be represented in terms of constraints that should be satisfied.&nbsp;Thus, any good constraint satisfaction procedure, such as spreading activation and settling, automatically applies to lots of different things.</P>
<P>Finally, localized networks enjoy a degree of <STRONG>neurological plausibility</STRONG> because network settling is a <STRONG>parallel</STRONG> process, as opposed to the <STRONG>serial</STRONG>, step-by-step process associated with the execution of rules.&nbsp;In a rule-based system, rules are applied one at a time such that the search for the next rule can only begin when the application of the current rule has finished.&nbsp;The serial nature of this process is one reason why searching can be so effortful.&nbsp;Spreading activation, however, occurs throughout the whole network at once; each node looks after its own little job without waiting for all the other nodes to finish first.&nbsp;The neurons in your brain behave similarly, meaning that localized networks share some of the procedural properties of the brain.</P>
