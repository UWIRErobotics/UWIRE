<P>A similar account of explanation can be given using localized networks.&nbsp;When we explain something, we generally seek out the explanation that gives the best account of the available evidence, plus whatever else we know about the given situation.&nbsp;Again, it is fairly straightforward to model this sort of inference with a network of constraints.</P>
<P>The ECHO (Explanatory COherence) model of Thagard provides such a model.&nbsp;In ECHO, nodes represent either <STRONG>evidence</STRONG> or <STRONG>hypotheses</STRONG>.&nbsp;(Also, there is a special node, <STRONG>data priority</STRONG>, which serves to activate the immediate evidence in the given situation.)&nbsp;There are a couple of excitatory links, namely <STRONG>explanation</STRONG> and <STRONG>analogy</STRONG>.&nbsp;An explanation link exists between evidence and each hypothesis that would explain that evidence.&nbsp;Also, an explanatory link exists between hypotheses that explain the same piece of evidence. An analogy link exists between similar hypotheses that explain similar evidence.&nbsp;(As we know, analogy is a complex relationship, but it is reduced to a simple one here for the purpose of convenience.)</P>
<P>There are two kinds of inhibitory link in ECHO, namely <STRONG>contradiction</STRONG> and <STRONG>competition</STRONG>.&nbsp;A contradiction link exists between two pieces of evidence that are incompatible with each other, i.e., they cannot both be true of the same situation.&nbsp;A competition link exists between hypotheses that both explain a certain piece of evidence but are not compatible with each other.</P>

<P>Suppose you expect to meet your friend Fred at the cafeteria but he does not show up.&nbsp;You find out from a mutual friend that Fred was in the library recently. Probably, you would try to reach a good explanation for this evidence, in light of your expectations and your general knowledge about your friend.</P>

<P>This network represents the constraints on forming the best explanation (from two candidates) of the observed evidence.&nbsp;It includes both the observed evidence, &#8220;Fred was in the library&#8221; and &#8220;Fred did not come to the cafeteria&#8221;, and further knowledge about Fred, namely that he wants high grades and likes to party.&nbsp;This network shows how hypotheses like &#8220;Fred is studying&#8221; sit in relations to further hypotheses, about Fred&#8217;s motivations (&#8220;Fred wants high grades&#8221;) and his interests (&#8220;Fred likes to party&#8221;).&nbsp;If we feed activation into the network via the EVIDENCE node and allow it to settle, the active nodes will correspond to the best hypothesis among the available possibilities.</P>
