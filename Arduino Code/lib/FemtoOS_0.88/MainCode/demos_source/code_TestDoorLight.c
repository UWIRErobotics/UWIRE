/**
 * This file is the program for controlling a lamp using one capacitive switch.
 * State of the system is displayed using one led. In steady state the led
 * is weakly lit, just enough to find the switch in the dark. Touching the
 * switch once, activates the lamp, for about 2 minutes. The led will start
 * blinking. The following scheme is displayed in repetition:
 *   5 sec on:           Switching now increased the on-timer
 *   1,2,3 or 4 blinks:  Showing the internal mode: (2min, 15min, 60min, 4hour on).
 *   5 sec on:           Switching now  turns lamp of.
 * See also the schematics attached.
 */

 * PA0 out : led beacon (making it easy to find the switch in the dark)
